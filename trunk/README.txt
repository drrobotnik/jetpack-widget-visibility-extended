This plugin is a proposed enhancement of the Jetpack Widget Visibility module. It allows plugin developers to extend the widget visibility options so that they can add additional options and fields.

This plugin adds actions/filters so that plugin developers can add additional filters based on thier needs. See "Jetpack Widget Visibility - Query Args" and "Jetpack Widget visibility - WPML Languages" as two examples of what you can do with this enhancement.
